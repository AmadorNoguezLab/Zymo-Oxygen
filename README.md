Systems-level Analysis of Oxygen Exposure in Zymomonas mobilis: Implications for Isoprenoid Production

This repository contains the raw data used to generate the metabolomics data shown in Figures 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, S2, S3, S5, and S7 of Martien et al. 2019.

The folders Alongside Proteomics, Alongside Transcriptomics, Alongside Extracellular, and For IDP/DMADP contain the raw data from four seperate iterations of the two-hour oxygen exposure time-course, as described in Materials and Methods subsection "Two-hour oxygen exposure time-course". Each folder contains the growth curve for that iteration, the mzxml files used to visualize metabolite peaks and extract signal intensity values using MAVEN, and a tab-delimited file with extracted signal intensites for each metabolite.
